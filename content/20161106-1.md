## Solvespace

### 1. Parts (零件繪製)

範例檔案: <a href="http://solvespace.com/bracket.pl">http://solvespace.com/bracket.pl</a>

An introductory tutorial is available, in which we draw the same part that is shown in the demo video. 

This covers most of the basic features of SolveSpace, including sketches, constraints, extrusions, and Boolean operations.

When we first run SolveSpace, we will begin with an empty part. Initially, our view of the part will be oriented onto the XY plane; the label for that plane is displayed at the bottom left of the screen (#XY, in dark grey). The axes are also indicated by the three colored arrows at the bottom left; the X, Y, and Z axes are drawn in red, green, and blue respectively.

When we hover the mouse over any entity, constraint, or other object in the sketch, that object will appear highlighted in yellow. For example, the XY plane, which is drawn as a dashed square, will appear highlighted when we hover the mouse over it. The YZ and ZX planes initially look like dashed lines, because they are being viewed on edge; but they still appear highlighted in yellow when we hold the mouse over them. It is similarly possible to highlight the X, Y, and Z axes (which are drawn as arrows), or the origin (which like all points is drawn as a green square).

#### Extrude (平行長出或除料)

#### Lathe (旋轉繞行長出或除料)

#### 零組件繪圖練習

利用 Solvespace, 以 <a href="./../data/w12/College_Student_Primer_Creo_2.pdf">College_Student_Primer_Creo_2.pdf</a> 為範本, 編寫一本 Solvespace 零組件導引 pdf 手冊.

利用 .md 檔案格式編寫, 建立導引手冊所需的圖文資料後, 設法利用 Pandoc 與 LaTeX 轉為 html 與 pdf 檔案.

首先必須設法編譯 Solvespace 原始碼, 取得 Windows 10 64 位元與 Ubuntu 16.04 64 位元環境下執行的 solvespace.exe 與 solvespace.

啟動 Solvespace 後, 在 View 功能表下確定所使用的尺寸單位, 選擇 mm 作為繪圖單位.

根據尺寸繪製一個 block.

#### Export Triangle Mesh

STL 格式

將零件檔案轉出 STL 格式後 (binary or ASCII format definitions), 進入倉儲後, 利用 <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/3d-file-viewer/">Github 內建的 stl viewer 功能</a>展示.

### 2. Assembly (零件組立)

<a href="http://solvespace.com/box.pl">http://solvespace.com/box.pl</a>

To start, we would like to define the orientation of the part. We can do that by locking one of the part's normals in the same orientation as one of our coordinate axes. Here, a good choice would be to constrain any of the base's normals—which are drawn as blue arrows—in the same orientation as our coordinate system's Z axis, which is also drawn as a blue arrow, in this view pointing approximately up from the origin. Select those two normals by left-clicking them, and choose Constrain → Same Orientation, or the equivalent constraint from the toolbar.

The two normals are now each marked with a magenta X, which is visible above. (It doesn't matter which of the normals on the part were chosen to constrain, since they all point in the same direction. The choice is arbitrary.) This means that those two normals are constrained to point in the same direction (i.e., parallel); but it also locks the twist of the part about that axis, so it fully constrains the part's orientation. The same-orientation constraint is useful, because it completely specifies a part's orientation with a single constraint.

We can try to drag the part's orientation and rotation now. We will find that it is still possible to translate the part anywhere, but impossible to rotate it, because that rotation is now fixed. To define the translation, we can use a point-coincident constraint. Select the two points marked in red in the image above, and choose Constrain → On Point. The two points will now be constrained to be coincident, locking the imported part's translation. The imported part is now fully constrained.

### 3. Linkages (fourbar & multilink) (四連桿與多連桿運動模擬)

四連桿:

利用線架構完成四連桿模擬後, 將 3D 零件以點重合, 點在面與點在線上約束各連桿後完成.

多連桿:  <a href="http://solvespace.com/linkage.pl">http://solvespace.com/linkage.pl</a>

### 4. Compiled & API (編譯與延伸應用)

使用 Virtualbox 虛擬主機執行 Windows 64 位元與 Ubuntu 64 位元環境中的編譯與延伸應用.

Virtualbox Ubuntu 64位元虛擬檔案: <a href="http://140.130.17.17/public/Ubuntu/1604_solvespace_final/Ubuntu_160464.vdi">http://140.130.17.17/public/Ubuntu/1604_solvespace_final/Ubuntu_160464.vdi</a> (只有在區網可以下載)
